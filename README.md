### Architecture Overview
Data is extracted from Scopus via an API.
Raw data is stored securely in Snowflake.
Transformation processes (cleaning, preprocessing, and modeling) are applied using PySpark.
Fact and dimension tables are stored in SQL Server.
Dashboards are built using Power BI to visualize trends, insights, and key metrics.

### **Tools & Technologies Used:**
- **Scopus and its Api**: Data soursce
- **Snowflake**: Raw Data storage.
- **pyspark**: Data Preprocessinh and analysis
- **SQL Server**: data model
- **Power BI**: Data visualization.  


## üìÇ **Dataset**

**Data Source:**
- The raw data originates from Scopus, an academic research database.
- Data is fetched via an API to extract relevant information about publications, authors, collaborations, and more.

- **Tables**: 6 main tables  

**Data Categories Include:**  
1. Author Information  
2. Publication Details  
3. Citations and References  
4. Affiliations and Conferences  
5. Geographical Insights  


## üîß **Data Preprocessing**

The following extraction and preprocessing steps were performed:

1. **Data Extraction**:  
   - Authors Table  
   - Affiliations Table  
   - Geographic Table (Countries, Cities)  
   - Moroccan and Foreign Universities  

2. **Data Transformation**:  
   - Extracted author IDs and split names using **regular expressions**.  
   - Integrated affiliations and publication metadata.
